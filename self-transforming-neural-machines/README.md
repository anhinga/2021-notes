### Let's revisit various issues related to self-transforming neural machines.

The history of our approach to self-transforming neural machines starts with May 2016 preprint
by our group, _Dataflow matrix machines as programmable, dynamically expandable, self-referential generalized recurrent neural networks_,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05296

Our understanding of the self-transforming aspect of dataflow matrix machines
and the experiments we have conducted with those machines are summarized
in Section 3, _Self-modification, learning to learn, and neuroevolution_, of
_Dataflow Matrix Machines: a Collaborative Research Agenda_,
