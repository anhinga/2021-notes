# Three views on dataflow matrix machines (2015-2020)

### Continuously deformable stream-oriented progams working with linear streams
  
This is the orginal view. This is why dataflow matrix machines were invented in 2014-2015.

### Generalized recurrent neural networks working with linear streams instead of streams of numbers

### "Super-transformers": each input of a super-neuron in a dataflow matrix machine is an attention device combining incoming linear streams together
