# 2021 design and research notes

This is a continuation of

I am continuing my transition from Python to Julia and 
from PyTorch to the next generation of machine learning frameworks such as
Julia Flux and JAX:

The `research-drafts` directory contains a useful write-up of issues one needs to address
if one wants to fully implement DMMs in PyTorch. However, my recommendation is to
implement DMMs in something like Julia Flux and JAX which fit DMMs much better
(see the `research-notes` directory).
