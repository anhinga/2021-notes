# 2021 design and research notes

This is a continuation of

I am continuing my transition from Python to Julia and 
from PyTorch to the next generation of machine learning frameworks such as
Julia Flux and JAX:

https://github.com/anhinga/2020-julia-drafts

The `research-drafts` directory contains a useful write-up of issues one needs to address
if one wants to fully implement DMMs in PyTorch. However, my recommendation is to
implement DMMs in something like Julia Flux and JAX which fit DMMs much better
(see the `research-notes` directory).

The `mind-games` directory contains my old spec for "non-invasive" brain-computer interfaces.

It might be that the time has come to start resurrecting this line of thinking.

---

The `matrix-mult-machines` directory focuses on my key experimental activity this year: study of
machines where matrix multiplication plays a key role, and visual study of matrix multiplication
performed by interpreting monochrome images as matrices and multiplying them using matrix multiplication.

So far this looks very promising.
