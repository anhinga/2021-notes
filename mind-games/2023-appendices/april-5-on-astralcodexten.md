The tail end of my remarks at https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/most-technologies-arent-races/comment/14254262

ME:
> And if we are talking, in particular, about sentience angle, we could do better at tackling the "hard problem of consciousness" and all that (trying to make actual progress in that direction is not risk-free, to say the least, but we could do much more than the current unsatisfactory state of thing, both in theoretical work on this problem and in possible experimental work).

Xpym:
> What would you consider to be a promising experimental setup? The problem is hard precisely because it is predicated on the subjective experience, something that's hard enough to study in presumably similar humans, never mind radically different entities.

ME:

> We should ponder feasible experiments in creating hybrid consciousness between tightly coupled biological entities and electronic circuits. Such experiments might start shedding some empirical light into the capacity of electronic circuits to support subjective experience and might constitute initial steps towards acquiring the ability to eventually be able "to look inside the other entity's subjective realm".

> In particular, if we want "true empathy" in the advanced AI systems, we'll need the advanced AI systems both to acquire the capability to have subjective experience at all, and moreover, to eventually be able "to look inside the other entity's subjective realm". So we should start making first technical steps in that general direction.

> Having Neuralink-like BCIs is not a hard requirement in this sense. A sufficiently tight coupling can probably be achieved by taking high-end EEG and polygraph-like signals from the biological entity and giving appropriately sculpted audio-visual signals from the electronic entity. I think it's highly likely that such non-invasive coupling will be sufficient for initial experiments. Tight closed loops of this kind represent formidable safety issues even with non-invasive connectivity, and since this line of research assumes that human volunteers will try this at some point, while observing the resulting subjective experiences and reporting on them, ethical and safety considerations will have to be dealt with.

> Nevertheless, assuming that one finds a way for such experiments to go ahead, one can try various things. E.g. one can train a variety of differently architected electronic circuits to approximate the same input-output function, and see if the observed subjective experiences differ substantially depending on the architecture of the electronic circuit in question. A positive answer would be the first step to figuring out how activity of an electronic circuit can be directly associated with subjective experiences.

Xpym:
> Sure, this sort of thing might work, if the closest path to AGI is something like brain emulation. I don't think that the current state of related technology is of help with LLM-like architectures, and probably won't be for a while.

ME: 
> I think that including circuits inspired by electronic music and VJ art might be promising. A lot of phenomena in that space do feel like they are almost ready to "wake up".
> 
> In any case, that would be the whole point of doing experiments (e.g. it might turn out that actual spiking analog circuits are different from their digital emulations in this sense, or it might turn out that digital emulation is the same as the analog circuit itself).
> 
> If people start getting some results in this sense, then they might ponder whether to hybridize some of the more "conscious substrate" with usual LLMs (although one should try to include current LLMs in those experiments as well, together with other choices of electronic circuits; the idea is to try to see experimentally what kinds of circuits seem to be able to support subjective experience, without excluding any of them a priori).
