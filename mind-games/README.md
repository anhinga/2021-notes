### "The Mind Game": brain-computer interfaces design notes

There was "The Mind Game" series of 6 posts between May 25, 2012 and June 25, 2012. 
The community blog hosting those posts disappeared, and I resurrected those post in a blog on May 11-12, 2019.

Of course, a lot has happened in the field of brain-computer interfaces between 2012 and 2019 (consumer-ready EEGs,
consumer-ready VR, and so on). However now we have some fresh Neuralink demos with a macaque monkey 
confidently controlling a computer game by mental effort, and this seems to be
a good time to bring these **brain-computer interfaces design notes** here.
